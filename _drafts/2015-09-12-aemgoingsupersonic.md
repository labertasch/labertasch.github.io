## What is going Supersonic?

- Time to Market
- Performance Scalability
- ...

And we are sure, there are many other valid definitions out there - aren’t there?


## Time To Market
The Time it takes - from the Marketers Idea - to Development - to Production
It could also be:

## Performance
The Time it takes to use and load the application in production

## Scalability
and/or the possibility to scale the application for a bigger audience or more/heavy usage.


## What do we deliver?
- Websites
- Phones
- Tablets
And many new channels we don’t even know about yet
